# Project: Lunar Surface Logistics Availability Model

### Executive Summary
Standard revenue modeling for lunar logistics assumes 100% equipment availability. However, thermal simulation of the Lunar South Pole reveals a **"Thermal Availability Gap"** where extreme surface heat flux (>450 W/m²) exceeds physical heat rejection limits.

**The Bottom Line:** At Lunar Noon, payload availability must be throttled. Logistics contracts must account for this exclusion window to prevent SLA (Service Level Agreement) breaches.
