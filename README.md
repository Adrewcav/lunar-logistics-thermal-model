# Project: Lunar Surface Logistics Availability Model

### Executive Summary
Standard revenue modeling assumes 100% equipment availability. Using a custom Python (NumPy) thermal simulation reveals a **Thermal Availability Gap** where extreme surface heat flux (>450 W/m²) exceeds physical heat rejection limits.

**The Bottom Line:** At Lunar Noon, payload availability must be throttled. Logistics contracts must account for this exclusion window to prevent SLA (Service Level Agreement) breaches. Dynamic mission planning (automation) and radiator innovations would be highly desirable investment areas.
